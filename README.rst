# California housing

Analysis of the price of the housing in california using the scikit-learn dataset. The data are from the 1990 census which are not relevant for today. I recommend to check the description: [](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#california-housing-dataset)

In the notebook, I conduct an analysis on the data and then perform a regression to predict the price of new house.
